Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to extract features (characteristics, properties, attributes) from raw data.
All machine learning algorithms use some input data to create outputs. This input data comprise features, which are usually in the form of structured columns. Algorithms require features with some specific characteristic to work properly. Here, the need for feature engineering arises.
Engineered features should capture additional information that is not easily apparent in the original feature set.
